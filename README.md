# ![Linkr](static/logo.svg)

A modern self-hosted URL Shortener for both individuals and organizations thatâ€™s easy to set up and use.

Built with Rust (using Rocket) for the backend and Svelte for the frontend.

Currently this project is still in its early stages. It is a fully functional URL shortener, but many quality of life features are still to come.

## Deployment

> Note: Make sure you set up HTTPS (user passwords are transmitted)

### To Heroku

Just click here and follow the instructions on screen to deploy:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/liamrosenfeld/linkr/tree/master)

To have user login sessions persist between server restarts, create an [environment variable](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars) with the name `ROCKET_SECRET_KEY` and then run `openssl rand -base64 32` in a terminal and paste the result in the value.

> Note: If using Heroku with Cloudflare use the Heroku app url, not the one they tell you to use when setting up a DNS

### Elsewhere

You can deploy with docker to a wide range of hosts as long a you provide these environment variables at runtime:

- `PORT` (Most often passed by the host)
- `DATABASE_URL` (For the postgres database. Incudes login info for database)
- `ROCKET_SECRET_KEY` (Used for signing private cookies. Generate it by running `openssl rand -base64 32` in a terminal)

## Setup

1. Go to the page `/setup` to create your first account before you publicly release the website
2. Go to `/new_user` to create accounts for the rest of your team

## Local Development

Steps to run on localhost:8000
